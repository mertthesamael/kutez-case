# KUTEZ-Case

This is the case-study that i've done for Kutez.

This project, calculates estimated shipping time by given product type, quantity, and date.

I've created API using **Node/Express** and for the front end, i used **ReactJS, SASS, React-Query, Axios and DayJS**

If the product type equals to 'COTTON' and quantity is less than 50 pieces, shipping time is 2 business days, if quantity it's more then it's 3 business days.
Else if product tpye is Linen and quantity is less than 50 pieces, shipping time is 4 business days, if it's more than 50, result is 5 business days later.

For responesiveness, here is what it's looks like in mobile and tablets ;
